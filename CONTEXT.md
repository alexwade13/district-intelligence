# District Intelligence Platform - AI Context File

## Overview
This is a Progressive District Intelligence Platform built for NYC Democratic Socialist organizing. It transforms a standard election results visualization app into a strategic tool for progressive electoral analysis and field organizing.

## Current State
**Base Technology Stack:**
- Next.js 15.3.3 (React framework)
- MapLibre GL (map rendering)
- Maptiler (map tiles with API key)
- D3.js (data visualization and color scales)
- SWR (data fetching)
- Theme UI (styling)

**Current Functionality:**
- âœ… Interactive NYC map with Assembly Districts and Election Districts
- âœ… **Electoral Performance Analysis** (2021 Maya Wiley â†’ 2025 Zohran Mamdani comparison)
- âœ… Local API endpoint serving candidate performance data
- âœ… Click-to-explore district details with performance metrics
- âœ… Five data views: Growth Categories, 2021 Baseline, 2025 Current, Growth Rate, Vote Share Change
- âœ… Color-coded growth/decline heatmaps with trend categories
- âœ… Dynamic methodology panels with context-specific explanations
- âœ… Numerical metrics display with precise 2-decimal formatting
- âœ… Assembly District aggregation (averages when no district selected)
- âœ… Clean, neutral language avoiding editorial commentary
- âœ… Responsive design with mobile support

- **Field organizing capacity data** (DSA membership, volunteer targets)

## Technical Architecture

### API Structure
```
/api/data/
â””â”€â”€ progressive-evolution.js # Maya 2021 â†’ Zohran 2025 comparison data
```

### Key Components
```
/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ constants.js        # Candidate colors, map styles, data mappings
â”œâ”€â”€ load.js            # Data fetching with SWR
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.js           # Map interaction handlers
â””â”€â”€ layers/            # Map layer management
```

### Map Configuration
- **Base maps**: Maptiler streets-v2 (color) and basic-v2 (monochrome)
- **Districts**: Assembly Districts (broader) and Election Districts (granular)
- **Interactions**: Click, hover, filter, zoom
- **Visualizations**: Opacity-based heatmaps, candidate-specific coloring

## Environment Setup
```bash
# Required environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY=UlTB185dHUZ3XxkVvU7W

# Development
npm install
npm run dev  # http://localhost:3000
```

## Current Data Flow

### Electoral Performance Analysis Mode
1. **Frontend** requests data from `/api/data/progressive-evolution`
2. **API** processes 2021 + 2025 CSV files from `district_candidate_research`
3. **Map** renders growth/decline patterns with color-coded categories
4. **Visualization** shows before/after comparison with performance metrics
5. **Interaction** displays growth percentages and trend analysis

## Recently Completed Enhancements
- âœ… **Electoral Performance Analysis**: 2021 Maya Wiley â†’ 2025 Zohran Mamdani comparison
- âœ… **Growth Visualization**: Color-coded categories (Major Growth, Growth, Decline, Major Decline)
- âœ… **Performance API**: Real-time processing of CSV data from district_candidate_research
- âœ… **Dynamic Methodology**: Context-specific calculation explanations for each data view
- âœ… **Code Cleanup**: Removed inline comments and simplified to single-purpose demo
- âœ… **Interface Streamlining**: Focused solely on candidate performance analysis
- âœ… **Neutral Language**: Changed "Progressive Indicator" to "Data View" for objectivity
- âœ… **Enhanced Data Display**: Added precise numerical metrics alongside visual bars
- âœ… **Vote Share Change Implementation**: Fixed missing visualization for vote share changes
- âœ… **Assembly District Aggregation**: Shows overall AD36 averages when no district selected
- âœ… **Decimal Precision**: Standardized to 2 decimal places for all numeric displays

## Remaining Technical Improvements
- Better error handling for missing evolution data
- Mobile optimization for evolution metrics display
- Caching for CSV processing performance
- Additional progressive candidates integration

## File Structure Notes
```
district-intelligence/
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.local                 # Contains Maptiler API key
â”œâ”€â”€ Mayor+(Democratic).json    # Current data source (83k+ lines)

â””â”€â”€ public/shapes/           # Additional shape files
```

## Integration Opportunities
The `/DSA/district_candidate_research/` folder contains a complete Python pipeline for processing NYC election data that could be integrated:
- `process_ad_election_data.py` - One-command data processing
- Pre-generated heatmaps for Assembly District 36
- RCV analysis tools for detailed ballot examination

## Development Guidelines
- **Map tiles**: Use Maptiler standard maps (streets-v2, basic-v2) with provided API key
- **Data format**: Maintain district-level aggregation for performance
- **Color schemes**: Utilize D3 scales for progressive strength visualization
- **Responsive design**: Maintain mobile-first approach with Theme UI
- **Local development**: All data sources are local files (no external dependencies)
